    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>In September of 2021, this website was created with the intentions of completing COP4813, or Web Systems 1 at Daytona State. This class was a requirement for the BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) program. There are fifteen weekly assignments in this class, and each assignment requires a change to be made to this website.    </p>
