                One-Paged Single Spaced Introspective
            </header>

            <p class="organize"> Throughout this class I have gained some skills that I didn’t have before. Prior to taking this class, I
                had used JavaScript twice and wasn’t very comfortable. After several assignments that were mainly
                enabled by JavaScript, I am much more comfortable with it. Also, getting this site gave me valuable
                experience with domains. I have never used or even considered the use of domains in web creation (which
                I know sounds contradictory). Now I believe I can make a domain and fund it properly in much less time
                than it initially took me. <br><br>
                Being able to work with an official client has also been an experience. My team and I have experience
                with maintaining regular contact with a real business and adjusting our final product to their needs.
                Our team ran into some issues with WordPress and as a result, we had to spend around three hours one day
                fixing the client’s website. This was a perfect example of what might happen in the real workplace. It
                also encouraged the team to get a little more familiar with WordPress, so we’re not doing things we
                don’t understand and ruin their site in a more permanent, unrecoverable way. This also happens to be my
                first experience with WordPress. As a result, I had to spend hours learning how it worked and exploring
                Elementor, a WordPress addon they used for their sites. All in all, it was time well spent, and I can
                surely say I have learned a great amount throughout this client project.<br><br>
                This semester in general has helped me with my overall time management as well. This semester, I got my
                first real job, so I have now accustomed myself to a more rigid and consistent work/school/personal
                schedule to accommodate for all fields.<br><br>
                I would like to get into the field of web development. It seems like a field that will not change for
                several years, ensuring me a steady field of work for a good amount of time. Other fields I have looked
                into don’t seem as viable as this one. After looking into what businesses looking for web developers
                want, I think I have some ways to go. They generally ask for experience with HTML and CSS, ability to
                create an aesthetic, functional responsive website, 5+ years of web development experience, Bachelor’s
                degree in Computer Science or a related discipline, strong GIT experience, React and Angular, experience
                troubleshooting and measuring performance, and much more. Just out of the few general requirements I
                have listed, I only satisfy three of the requirements. These requirements are “experience with HTML and
                CSS,” (these are the most basic languages; I have worked with them for years) “ability to create an
                aesthetic/functional website” (if I am given an extended amount of time to do so), and “strong GIT
                experience” (I have used git tools at a basic level since I first began using GitHub a few years ago,
                and I now hold advanced GIT experience).<br><br>
                Based on this information I have gathered; I have come up with a 2-year plan that I believe is more than
                achievable. I am expected to get my bachelor’s degree in IT in Spring 2023 at DSC. In the meantime, I
                will of course practice refining my skills with content-management systems (since many businesses
                require experience with these systems), and my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I will do so not only
                through my schooling, but also through outside practice in Visual Studio. I also plan to make occasional
                changes to the website that I have created for this class. Eventually, I can use this site as some sort
                of portfolio or perhaps for a business I create in the future. Before I get my bachelor’s degree, I want
                to get familiar with React or Angular; depending on the difficulty, I would like to learn both. I would
                like to perfect my GIT skills also before graduating, assuring myself I can do anything GIT involved
                without issues with understanding the code. I would also like to take at least three web development
                projects under my wing by December 2023. At that point, I expect to be comfortable enough to jump into a
                job.<br><br>
                Of course, I don’t know how skilled I will be, or how well I will do in the field at that time, so this
                is just speculation. I do plan to do something along these lines in the next couple of years.
